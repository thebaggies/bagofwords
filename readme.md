Bag of Words: (second) foreign language text creation

## Introduction
The "Bag of Words" project began as an experiment in intergenerational, cross-cultural communication. 

## Portable Bag of Words
The Bag of Words can be carried into many spaces. Here is one process - you can experiment with different forms:

### Supplies:
* bag
* scissors
* paper
* tape/glue

### How to Play:

#### Growing the Bag
*For each player*
1. Choose a language you don't know well (familiar but not native)
2. Write down words/phrases with translation in a shared language (e.g.:  contigo | with you) 
3. Cut up the words/phrases
4. Place in bag

#### Arranging the text
*For each player*
1. Take out a handful from the Bag
2. Arrange the words and phrases on a surface. Use paper and glue as you like - afix the words to your surroundings if you like. Arrangements can form letters, poems, lyrics, namings, titles.

#### Sharing the text (optional)
Exchange arrangements: 
  * With a friend
  * With a stranger
  * On [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thebagofwords/) [@thebagofwords](https://www.instagram.com/thebagofwords/)
  
#### Repeat!
Continue to Grow the Bag with new players.
